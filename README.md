# Minesweeper-in-development-

Minesweeper game currently in development using Python and Pygame.

All code is by me.

## Info

- Tiles that have a mine surrounding them will show a number representing the number of surrounding mines
- Cannot yet win or lose the game
- Cannot yet flag tiles
- When a tile is pressed, sometimes a bug occurs where other tiles further away will become selected
- Number of remaining mines not yet displayed
